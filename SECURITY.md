# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues related specifically to the ASH implementation may be
reported privately to:

**3maem2025@gmail.com**

Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities without prior coordination.

## Threat Model Assumptions

ASH assumes:
- The request is generated by a trusted client at the time of generation
- TLS/HTTPS is used for transport security
- Authentication and authorization are handled externally

ASH does not attempt to secure environments that are already compromised.

## Security Boundaries

ASH provides request-level integrity validation and single-use
enforcement only.

ASH validates whether request inputs have been altered or replayed,
not whether a request is safe, authorized, or appropriate to execute.

While these properties may reduce the feasibility or impact of certain
attack scenarios, ASH is not designed, represented, or intended to
function as an attack prevention, detection, or threat mitigation system.

ASH must not be treated as a standalone security control.
