# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues related specifically to the ASH implementation may be
reported privately to:

**3maem2025@gmail.com**

Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities without prior coordination.

## Threat Model Assumptions

ASH assumes:
- The request is generated by a trusted client at the time of generation
- TLS/HTTPS is used for transport security
- Authentication and authorization are handled externally

ASH does not attempt to secure environments that are already compromised.

## Security Scope

For detailed information about ASH's security scope, boundaries, and limitations,
see the [README](README.md#security-scope-and-explicit-boundaries).
